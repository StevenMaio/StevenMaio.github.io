I recently completed undergrad at Stony Brook University with a double major
in Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently, I've gotten involved with
some projects at SUNY ESF in Syracuse, NY.

My interests include Mathematics, Computers, Go, Video Games, Homebrewing, Music,
German, and LÃ«tzebuergesch. I also enjoy running, and hiking!

A link to my GitHub page can be found on the bottom if you're interested in
looking at my projects.
