I'm an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University. I'm double majoring in
Mathematics and Comptuer Science. At the moment I'm interning with SRC in
Syracuse, NY.

My interests include Mathematics, Computers, Video Games, Homebrewing Music,
German, and Chinese (to an extent). I'm also a fan of hiking, running, and
lifting, but I have had to take a break due to an injury from the latter.

My GitHub page can be found on the bottom, if you're interested in looking
at my projects.
