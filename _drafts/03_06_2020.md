Earlier today I was working on a problem out of my _Real Analysis_ textbook
which kept my in place for a while. The problem is as follows:

> Show that the set  of irrationals in $[0,1]$ does not have measure zero in 
> $ \mathbb{R} $

To solve this, my thought was that we could transform any cover of $ E
= [0,1] \cup \mathbb{Q}^C$ into a cover of $[0,1]$. This did eventually
work for me, but where I went wrong was the process of turning a cover
of $ E $ into a cover of $[0,1]$. Here was my original attempt.

Let $ \{ I_n \} $ be an open cover of $E$, and let $ \epsilon > 0$, you can
probably see where I was going with this. Suppose that each $I_n = (a_n, b_n)$,
and for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $ J_n = (a_j - \frac{\epsilon}{2^n},
b_n + \frac{\epsilon}{2^n})$. It's clear from here that the union of the
$J_n$'s will still cover $E$, and I made the mistake of assuming that this
should cover $[0,1]$. The cool thing about the $J_n$'s is that the sum of
their lengths isn't significantly greater than that of the $I_k$'s, since

$$
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ell(J_n)
    = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Bigg(\ell(I_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^{n-1}}\Bigg)
    = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ell(I_n) + 2 \epsilon
$$

and because they supposedly cover $[0,1]$, then their sum is bounded below by
1, and altogether this gives us

$$
    1
    \le \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ell(J_n)
    = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ell(I_n) + 2 \epsilon
$$

from which we can extract

$$
    1 - 2 \epsilon
    \le \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ell(I_n)
$$

and because $\epsilon$ is just any positive number, this tells us that
$ 1 \le \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ell(I_n)$.

So everything there is correct, except for how we construct the $J_n$'s.
At the end of this I will explain how to construct that particular sequence,
but I'm going to first show why the original method doesn't work with a
simpler example.

Let's look at the sequence of intervals $I_n = (\frac{1}{n}, 1)$. First off,
let's make a note that $ (0,1) = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n$ and 0 is a
limit point of this union. If $\epsilon > 0$, then it's entirely possible
that the union of $\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} J_n = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}
(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{\epsilon}{2^n},1) = (0,1)$. For example, if $\epsilon = 1$,
then $ \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2^n} > 0$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So doesn't
work for arbitrary $\epsilon > 0 $.

Okay. Now let's talk about how we construct the desired sequence $ \{ J_n \}$.
Well, it turns out that I'm pretty dumb. Hopefuly you know this, by the set of
rational numbers in $[0,1]$ is null, and so there is a sequence of intervals
$ \{ I^\prime_k \} $ such that $[0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q} \subset \cup_{k \in
\mathbb{N}} I^\prime_k$. But these two sequences can be combined into
another sequence of intervals, which is the desired $ \{ J_k \}$.
