When I took Real Analysis (some time ago), we were given a
brief introduction to the use of [Dedekind cuts](dedekind-cut) to construct the
real numbers, while having the Cauchy sequence construction teased without
further elaboration. At the time I remember finding Dedekind cuts to be a
rather difficult concept to grasp, and the use of Cauchy sequences sounded
like a more natural approach to this problem.

Thus, this goal of this series to provide a construction of $ \mathbb{Q} $
using the theory of metric spaces, and this post will outline the completion
the rational numbers to create the real numbers. Here is a outline of the
series:

1. An outline of the definitions, and terminology used
2. A construction of $ \mathbb{R} $ using Cauchy sequences (as well as a proof
that this is indeed a field)
3. A proof of the completeness of $ \mathbb{R} $
