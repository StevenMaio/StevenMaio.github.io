## Python Tutorial

My next project is a tutorial for programming in Python. I don't plan on going
very deep into the material. I want to cover functions, basic stuff in python,
like opening files, maybe web sockets, reading from .csv files.


### Road Map

1. Introduction (why learn Python, what can you do with it, etc.) 
    1. What can you do with Python?
    2. Learning a programming language leads to learning more programming

2. Python basics, declaring variables, variable types, etc.
    1. Declaring a variables
    2. Operations
    3. Strings, and string operations
3. Loops, conditionals, etc.
    1. If... then
    2. Else
    3. While
    4. For
4. Introduction to functions, using pre-defined functions
    1. open
    2. csv, etc.
5. Declaring functions
    1. Arguments
    2. Scope
    3. Return 
    4. Inner functions(?)
6. Dictionaries
    1. Was sind sie denn?
