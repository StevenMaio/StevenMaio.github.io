I'm gonna put more effort into my writing. So, I'm going to try to write up
something at least twice a week in May.

I think I'm going to work on focusing my time. To do this, I'm going to create
a rough schedule for the month and from there, I'm going to create  schedule
for every week.

Here are a few concrete tasks I want to accomplish in May:
1. Finish reading *How to Read a Book*
2. Finish reading *Der Zug war p√ºnktlich*
3. Read/Start the Illiad
4. Make progress in the Functional Analysis textbook
5. Work on the whiteboard drawing program
7. Something else?
8. Attend the local Software-Meetup
9. Learn C++ (I might be forced to do this because of work)
10. Mess around with a compression tool for images

Looking forward to making progress in May.
