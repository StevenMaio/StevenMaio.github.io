I think I'm going to work on focusing my time. To do this, I'm going to create
a rough schedule for the month and from there, I'm going to create  schedule
for every week.

Here are a few concrete tasks I want to accomplish in May:
1. ~~Finish reading *How to Read a Book*~~
2. ~~Finish reading *Der Zug war p√ºnktlich*~~
3. Read/Start the Illiad
4. ~~Make progress in the Functional Analysis textbook~~
5. ~~Work on the whiteboard drawing program~~
7. Something else?
8. Attend the local Software-Meetup **[didn't do this... ]**
9. ~~Learn C++ (I might be forced to do this because of work)~~
10. Mess around with a compression tool for images **[this has been put on
    hold]**

Looking forward to making progress in May.
